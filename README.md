# Jacob Venable's Portfolio

This repository is used to manage my personal web portfolio:
[jacobvenable.com](https://www.jacobvenable.com/)

I want to give a special thank you to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), who provides building and hosting the project ðŸŽ‰.

The project itself is built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), an awesome, React-based static-site generator.

## Installation

If you want to mess around with the site yourself, please feel free to clone the project and follow the installation directions below.

*NOTE: You may __NOT__ use my site as a skeleton to build your own. Sorry, I get possessive like that. ðŸ˜‰*

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Next, within the repo directory, locally install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

Then you can run your own local server with the site with:
```sh
gatsby develop
```

For information on the directory structure, this repository uses the default structure provided in a GatsbyJS v2 project.

Individual components I built for the site can be found in the **src/components** folder.
