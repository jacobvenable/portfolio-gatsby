# Jacob Venable's Portfolio

This repository is used to manage my personal web portfolio:


[jacobvenable.com](https://www.jacobvenable.com/)

I want to give a special thank you to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), who provides building and hosting for the project ðŸŽ‰.

The project itself is built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), an awesome, React-based static-site generator.

## Installation

*Note: This repository does also contain images for the sake of simple Netlify deployment. If you clone the repository, you will get these images as well.*

If you want to mess around with the site yourself, please feel free to clone the project and follow the installation directions below.

*NOTE: You may __NOT__ use my site as a skeleton to build your own. Sorry, I get possessive like that.* ðŸ˜‰

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Next, within the repo directory, locally install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

Then you can run the site on a local server with:
```sh
gatsby develop
```

For information on the directory structure, this repository uses the [default structure](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-project-structure/) provided in a GatsbyJS v2 project.

Individual components I built for the site can be found in the [src/components](https://github.com/jacobvenable/portfolio-gatsby/tree/master/src/components) folder.
